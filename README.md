To Companies Seeking Outstanding Asian Spanish-Speaking Professionals in Barcelona.

If your company is seeking skilled professionals of Asian descent or Spanish speakers in Barcelona, we highly recommend attending Mundiñol events.

At these gatherings, you will have the opportunity to connect with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds, including professionals from Japan, China and Taiwan, as well as Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries.

The members specialize in various fields, such as IT, web development, culinary arts, professional hospitality, customer service, sales, etc.

Those who have been part of Mundiñol for over a year come from different industries but share common traits: integrity, diligence, and reliability.

If you meet a potential candidate at a Mundiñol event who has been an active member for over a year, you can be confident that hiring them will be a decision you won’t regret.

We would be delighted to welcome you to one of our events. Please feel free to reach out if you would like further information.
